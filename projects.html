        <h2>Chess in PyGame</h2>
        <p class="projectDescription">
            While sitting at the animal hospital for four hours, I downloaded the 
            <a href="https://lichess.org/">lichess</a> chess app for my phone. I quickly
            became addicted to online chess (although that doesn't mean I've improved at all).
            To make better use of my time, I decided I would practice coding by making a working
            chess game in PyGame. Now, that I've completed that, I really want to train a model
            to play chess, although I haven't got there yet. The following is a video of the
            computer playing chess randomly with itself.
