                Obviously, this is not a picture of me, but a picture of my cat Drive-Thru nestled between flowers on a broken air hockey table.
                When I'm not working on school or at work, I enjoy hanging with this little guy.
                I also enjoy playing online chess or fiddling around on a keyboard (musical and computer).

                I'm currently working on a Data Science & Programming Support Services (AAS) degree at
                Wake Tech, and I also will be taking various math classes at Forsyth Tech. Why so many classes?
                My goal is to get a master's degree in computer science after I finish at Wake Tech,
                so I'm attempting to complete all the prerequisite courses by that time.

                In February, I started working at Whole Foods part time while I'm in school.
                This is the first time I haven't worked as a cook in a restaurant in a long time.
                I'm really enjoying it so far. If you're needing a part time job, I highly reccommend it.
                My friend reccommended it to me and she has a baby now. And, you can't argue with that.

                As I've said, I'm on journey to get a Master's in computer science, but in
                order to that. I need to get all my prerequisite math requirement. What I thought
                was going to be a simple task of enrolling in a Calculus I course turned into a <i>HUGE</i>
                ordeal. My high school Precalculus course no longer counted, but not only that, my high school
                Algebra course didn't count either! In order to place into Calculus, I had three weeks to relearn
                all of Precalulus Algebra and Trigonometry. <br><br> In three weeks, I went through a 1000 pages of
                a textbook and filled two notebooks; it was exhausting. Luckily, I have developed a love
                for math; I find it fun like a puzzle. Also, I have to shout out Stewart, Redlin, and Watson's
                <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Precalculus_Mathematics_for_Calculus.html?id=ApuaBAAAQBAJ">
                    <i>Precalculus: Mathematics for Calculus</i></a>, as that textbook saved my life. If you are going through something similar, I HIGHLY
                reccommend this textbook. It has all the important concepts in blue boxes. If math comes easy
                to you, you could just look at the blue boxes for everything you need to know.

                If you have checked out my <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page, then you
                know (like hundreds of thousands of people), I have recently gotten into chess.
                And, also like many people, I'm really bad at it. But I still find it so fun! I've never
                really been an online gamer, but now I play online chess everyday. If you're not familiar
                with online chess, you can play games with short time controls, so its perfect for taking
                a small break from school work. Chess has also inspired me to improve my programming and
                data science capabilities. I coded my own (simple) chess program, and I aspire to teach the
                computer to play too. I've recently started learning <a href="https://pytorch.org/features/">PyTorch</a>,
                and plan to spend a significant amount of time developing my skills during the break between semesters.
